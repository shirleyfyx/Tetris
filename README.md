<em> <h3> This is a Tetris game developed using Python's Pygame library. The objective of the game is to clear as many lines as possible by arranging tetrominoes (shapes made of four blocks) in horizontal lines without gaps. 

<p> An animation of flying blocks will be played when lines are cleared! </h3> </em>
